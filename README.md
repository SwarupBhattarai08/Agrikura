# Agrikura
A NLTK python chatbot that responds agricultural-related inquiries. I created this bot as a practice example while I was learning Natural Language Processing. The language package is extracted as an open-source from the internet.

This chatbot may or maynot function properly on your system. Some of the common issues I've noticed is lack of answering, slower runtime, and random crashes. Let me know if something arises.
